# Purpose

Due to lack of documentation on `SimpleTelegramClient` class by TD Light Team this module was born.

Consider this as a practice-oriented educational example on:

 * how to understand what the hell is going on in that class
 * how to build your own analog of `SimpleTelegramClient` using the same approach as TD Light developers did

## What was done:

1. All the necessary classes were converted from Java to Kotlin
2. the prefix `My` was added to all the rewritten classes to not be confused with original ones
3. The class fields and method were reordered within a class body to make the source code more clean
4. Comment lines were added to explain the classes behavior
5. Work in progress
6. PROFIT
